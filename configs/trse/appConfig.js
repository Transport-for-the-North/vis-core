  introduction:
    "<p>Transport-related social exclusion (TRSE) means that transport issues have a fundamental impact on everyday life, and limit the ability to fulfil everyday needs. This could mean being unable to access childcare or good job opportunities, facing poverty and financial hardship because of transport costs, or facing significant stress and anxiety from using the transport system as part of everyday life.</p>",
